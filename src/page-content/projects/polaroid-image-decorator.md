A web app built to add a polaroid-esque white border to images, with
multiple border/image sizing options. Created due to an inability to find a
good, free existing alternative. Requests are sent to a FastAPI backend which
applies the border and returns the result to the frontend. A CLI version also
exists which can convert multiple images at once.
