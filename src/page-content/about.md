### WHO AM I?

G'day! I'm Kevin, a software engineer based in Sydney, Australia. I
graduated from University of Sydney with a Bachelors of Computing and am
currently pursuing frontend development, with a future goal of learning backend.
I'm passionate about building scalable and performant software regardless of the
field. If you want to dive deeper into my career, feel free to check out my

### HOBBIES

Some of the things I'm currently interested in are:

-   ⌨ Mechanical keyboards: I've been very interested in building and customising
    mechanical keyboards since the pandemic started, with an equal focus on sound,
    feel and design. Although most of my planned builds are still MIA due to long
    shipping times, I've documented my completed builds over in the
    [keyboards](/keyboards) section.
-   📸 Photography: This is a more recent hobby I've picked up in my free time,
    due to a desire to capture the events of my life before I forget about them.
    I aim to catch the 'in the moment' feelings through photography, with a
    focus on both street and night photography. You can check out my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kev.l.caii/" target="\_blank" rel="noreferrer">instagram</a>
    for photos which I think look nice!
-   👩‍💻 Coding: I mean, I'm a software engineer. My entire _life_ is about
    coding so it makes sense that I'm interested in it!
