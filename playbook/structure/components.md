# Components

This directory contains all the UI components scoped
to a single page's content. For reusable components, they should live in
`common/` instead.

`{component-name}/`: Each component should live in its own separate directory,
exported through a `index.tsx` file. Additional files such as `messages.tsx` may
also be present but must not export any data used outside of the component.
Child components can be declared in nested directories, following the same file
structure to avoid parent imports
